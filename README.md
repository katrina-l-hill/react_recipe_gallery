# Building a Recipe Gallery in React

## Report
The Recipe Gallery component is a React-based project that displays a collection of recipes in a card-based layout. Each card showcases the recipe's title, ingredients, and an image. This project is designed to help developers understand list rendering in React through the use of static data.

Challenges faced include proper key assignment for list items and component structure and reusability. For proper key assignment for list items,  using the `id` property from the recipe data as a unique key to avoid potential issues was helpful. Regarding component structure and reusability, structuring the component sot hat the `recipes` array can be passsed as props or imported as needed was important to enhance modularity.
